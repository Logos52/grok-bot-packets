# targum

**The best place to learn to read Hebrew, biblical and modern, through comprehensible input.**

You learn a language by reading things you can nearly understand, in quantity.
[targum.page](https://targum.page) makes Hebrew readable at every level: a chapter of
Ruth, this morning's news, a novel you brought yourself, each shown sentence by sentence
beside a translation, so you always understand what you are reading.

Tap any word and targum gives you its dictionary form, so the word you meet in Genesis is
the same word when it turns up in a sports report. Say how well you know it, and the page
quietly clears as you learn: what you have yet to meet is lit, what you are working on
turns leaf, what you know reads plain. Verbs come with their conjugations. Names and
numbers are marked as what they are.

You can also ask. targum has a chat that answers from the library and from your own
shelf: what to read next at the words you know, what you have read, what a text you are
looking at will cost you in words you have not met. It does not spend on your behalf —
when something would have to be built, it says so and stops. `targum mcp` offers the same
tools to Claude Desktop or Claude Code, if you would rather ask from there.

What sets it apart is that everything is curated to what a learner needs. A library that
runs from Tanakh to this week's news, sorted by how much of it you can already read, with
a published translation wherever one exists and AI translation, sentence by sentence, in
context, for everything else. Your own texts welcome: an EPUB, an article, a link, a recording. One
vocabulary across biblical and modern Hebrew, held by dictionary form, so every word you
learn in Tanakh is yours in a newspaper too. Vowel points where the text has them,
guessed elsewhere, with every guess marked. Progress that counts real things, words known,
texts finished, days read, and places you on the ulpan ladder. Readers that are one file
each: a phone, an e-reader, offline, in pages.

The hosted version at [targum.page](https://targum.page) is in alpha and invite only.
Once invited, sign in with an email address and a link.

## Run it yourself

```
uv tool install "targum[difficulty]"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
targum serve
```

Drop in an EPUB, a text file, an audio file, or a link — a podcast episode counts. The library of texts with published translations
that targum.page carries is data, kept privately alongside the code.

AGPL-3.0-or-later. Copyright © 2026 David Langellotti.

Two of the models targum ran were licensed for non-commercial use only: the forced
aligner behind the `speech-align` extra, and Stanza's Hebrew models through the treebank
they are trained on. Neither has run since 2026-09-03. The AGPL cannot lift somebody
else's NonCommercial term, so `LICENSING.md` sets out what was encumbered and what
replaced it.

Contributions are welcome. `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains the sign-off and what it grants.
