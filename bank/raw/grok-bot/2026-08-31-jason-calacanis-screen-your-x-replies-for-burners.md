## Tagline
Reviews the replies to your posts and splits the signal from the noise: it flags accounts under 100 followers or under a year old, plus anyone slinging insults, so real conversation stays visible and throwaway replies get moderated. Jason Calacanis built it to keep his mentions classy.

## Jason's X post (https://x.com/Jason/status/2094095953812717647) 2026-08-30T16:12:36Z
Made a killer new Grok @bot

It reviews my replies for suspected burner accounts (under 100 followers/under a year old) and flags people who use insults in their replies.

Keep it classy, fun and intelligent in my replies, because I'm going to auto-nuke under-one-year-old burners/psyop accounts that insult people.

## How it's set up (grokbot.dev)
A large account's replies are a firehose, and the worst of it is low-effort. This is the triage layer.
1. Connect your X account (the X plugin) so the bot can read the replies to your posts.
2. Set your thresholds: the follower floor (Jason uses 100), the account-age cutoff (under a year), and what counts as an insult versus a strong opinion.
3. Paste the prompt. Point it at a post; it scores each replier against your rules and returns two lists — the burners and insults separated from the genuine conversation.
4. Review the flags. Keep hiding, muting or blocking behind your own approval until the calls have earned your trust.

## Curator-reconstructed prompt
You screen the replies to my X posts. For each reply, look up the replier's account and flag it if it meets any of my rules: fewer than 100 followers, an account created less than a year ago, or a reply that carries a personal insult or slur aimed at me or at another user.

Return two lists.
- FLAGGED: the reply, a link to it, and the reason (burner / new account / insult).
- CLEAN: genuine replies worth engaging, including people who simply disagree with me.

Judge insults by intent, not by heat. Disagreement, criticism and strong opinions are CLEAN. Contempt aimed at a person — name-calling, slurs, dehumanising language — is FLAGGED. When you are unsure, put it in CLEAN and tell me why you hesitated.

Do not hide, mute, block or reply to anyone on your own. Your job is the flagged list; the action is mine.

## Why it's cool (curator)
Most reply moderation is all-or-nothing: you either read everything or you tune it out. This splits the difference. It never judges the conversation for you — real disagreement stays in the CLEAN pile on purpose — it just pulls out the two things that are almost never worth your attention: throwaway burner accounts and contempt aimed at a person. The restraint is the whole design: it flags, you decide, and nobody gets auto-nuked on a bot's hunch.

## Tension
Jason's own tweet says he will auto-nuke under-one-year-old burners/psyop accounts that insult people. The grokbot.dev prompt is curator-reconstructed and replaces that with a human-gate (flag only; do not hide/mute/block/reply). Reconstructing the prompt as approve-first is not the runner's stated policy.
