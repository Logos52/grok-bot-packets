# ankiquest

XP, levels, streaks, daily quests, achievements and a leaderboard for Anki. The server only ever sees review log rows (card id, timestamp, previous interval, time taken, review type), never card content.

XP never depends on which answer button was pressed, so there is no incentive to grade dishonestly.

## Run

```sh
cargo run -- ankiquest.json
```

```json
{
  "addr": "127.0.0.1:8097",
  "state_dir": "state",
  "ntfy": "https://ntfy.sh",
  "remind_hour": 20,
  "public_url": "https://anki.example.com",
  "week_timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "week_rollover_hour": 4,
  "users": {
    "hill": { "display": "hill", "ntfy_topic": "some-secret-topic", "token_file": "hill.token" }
  }
}
```

Open `/#<user>` for a profile, `/` for the leaderboard. The leaderboard week runs Monday to Sunday in `week_timezone` and turns over at `week_rollover_hour` for everyone at once; each Anki day counts towards the week it started in. Streaks, quests and "today" still follow each player's own Anki day.

## Getting reviews in

Both clients upload new review rows after each answer and show XP feedback while reviewing. Sync itself can stay on AnkiWeb.

- AnkiDroid: install the [fork](https://github.com/float3/Anki-Android/tree/ankiquest) and fill in Settings → ankiquest.
- Desktop: zip the contents of `addon/` into `ankiquest.ankiaddon`, open it with Anki, then set `url`, `user` and `token` under Tools → Add-ons → ankiquest → Config.

`POST /api/reviews/<user>` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and

```json
{
  "reviews": [{ "id": 0, "cid": 0, "last_ivl": 0, "time_ms": 0, "kind": 0 }],
  "clock": { "offset_west_min": -120, "rollover_hour": 4 },
  "silent": false
}
```

stores the rows and returns the profile. `POST /api/preview/<user>` takes the same `reviews` without storing anything.

Alternatively set `sync_base` to the `SYNC_BASE` of a self-hosted Anki sync server: every folder in it with a `collection.anki2` becomes a player, and collections are copied before reading and never written.

## NixOS

```nix
inputs.ankiquest.url = "github:float3/ankiquest";

imports = [inputs.ankiquest.nixosModules.default];

services.ankiquest = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "anki.example.com";
  weekTimezone = "Europe/Berlin";
  ntfy = "https://ntfy.sh";
  users.hill = {
    tokenFile = "/etc/nixos/secrets/ankiquest-hill";
    ntfyTopic = "some-secret-topic";
  };
};
```
