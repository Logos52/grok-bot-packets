# Book Watcher

Turn an EPUB into something you *watch*: each sentence is read aloud by a neural voice
and shown big on screen like a subtitle. Chinese (Mandarin) and English, even mixed in
one book: the voice is chosen per sentence.

```sh
uv run book-watcher                 # open the library at http://127.0.0.1:8765
uv run book-watcher path/to/book.epub   # add a book and open it straight away
```

Then drop more EPUBs onto the library page.

- **Play / pause** with the big button or <kbd>Space</kbd>. <kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>A</kbd>/<kbd>D</kbd> sentence,
  <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd> paragraph.
- **Watch or Read** (switch in the top bar, or <kbd>R</kbd>): Read mode shows the book as ordinary
  flowing text (its own text size, chapters load as you scroll). Both modes share one position: switch
  and you continue from the same sentence. Select text to Mark, Copy, or *Listen from here*. Active
  reading counts toward reading stats.
- **Time left** under the progress bar: minutes left in the chapter and hours left in the book at your
  current speed, pauses included. The pace of each voice is learned from the clips you play.
- **Full screen** (<kbd>F</kbd>, or the ⛶ button): only the sentence being read. Tap the left third of the
  screen for the previous sentence, the middle to pause/resume, the right third for the next one
  (the zones are invisible). <kbd>Space</kbd> also pauses. A faint
  bookmark in the corner marks the sentence. <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>F</kbd> leaves.
- **Nine colour schemes**: Dark, Light, Sepia, Rose, Black (OLED), Night, Forest, High contrast, Terminal.
- **Installable app (PWA)**: use the browser's Install / Add to Home Screen (or the "Install app" button in
  the library) to get it as a standalone app with its own icon.
- **Settings follow you across devices**: font, size, theme, speed, volume, pauses, engine and voices are
  kept on the server (newest change wins). Sidebar layout stays per device.
- **Highlights** page (from the library): every marked sentence across your books (consecutive marked
  sentences merge into one passage), grouped by book and chapter or newest first, with search, "open in book", and export to Markdown or CSV (opens in Excel).
- **Reading stats** page, in the spirit of WeChat Read (微信读书): listening time per week, month, year or
  all time with a daily chart, daily average and change vs the previous period, days read, streaks,
  books read and finished, highlights made, and time per book. Time counts while a book is playing.
- Marks sync as individual changes, so reading on two devices at once never loses a mark.
- **Speed, volume, font, size, theme, voices, pauses**: the sliders under the play button and the settings panel (<kbd>,</kbd>).
- **Outline** tab (<kbd>O</kbd>): the book's table of contents as a foldable tree, with the section you're in
  highlighted and a filter box. Click any entry to jump there. If the EPUB's own TOC is sparse (only
  "Part 1…5", say), chapter headings found in the text are slotted in underneath.
- **Context sidebar** (<kbd>B</kbd> to fold): the paragraphs around the current sentence, following along as it plays.
  Click sentences to select them (Shift+click for a range, or drag across the text), then **Mark**.
  Double-click a sentence to play from there.
- **Marks** tab: every marked sentence by chapter. Click one to jump to it, or export them all as Markdown.
  <kbd>X</kbd> (or <kbd>M</kbd>) marks the sentence being read.

Speech comes from Microsoft's online neural voices via [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts)
(free, needs internet). Clips are cached in `data/tts/`, so anything already heard replays offline.
Settings → Engine → *Browser built-in* uses your browser's own voices instead, with no network needed.

Reading position and marks are saved per book in `data/books/<id>/state.json`.

## Running it online

### Accounts

Run locally without a password and there is one user and no sign-in. Set `BW_PASSWORD` (and optionally
`BW_ADMIN`, default `admin`) and the first start creates an **admin account** with that username and
password, and gives it the existing library. From then on accounts live in `users.json`:

- Sign in with username + password; sessions last 180 days. Changing or resetting a password signs that
  person out everywhere.
- The admin's **Account** page lists users and can create them (a password is generated if you leave it
  blank), rename them, reset their password, or delete them with their data.
- Everyone can change their own password there.
- Each user has their own library, positions, marks, highlights, reading stats and synced settings.
  Identical EPUBs are stored once and deleted when nobody has them any more.

Other settings: `BW_HOST`, `BW_PORT`, `BW_DATA`, and `BW_TTS_CACHE_MB` (prune the speech cache, least
recently used first, to this size).

### Deploying to a server

`deploy/` has everything for a Debian-style box with nginx and certbot: a systemd unit (runs as its
own system user, memory-capped), an nginx site, and `install.sh`, which sets them up and generates a
password for the admin account on first run.

```sh
HOST=myserver DOMAIN=books.example.com ./deploy.sh   # or put HOST=/DOMAIN= in a git-ignored deploy.local
ssh myserver sudo certbot --nginx -d books.example.com   # once DNS points at the server
```

Re-running `./deploy.sh` updates the code and restarts; the library and password are left alone.

- Service: `systemctl status book-watcher`; logs: `journalctl -u book-watcher`
- The first admin's password comes from `/etc/book-watcher.env` (`BW_PASSWORD=…`) on first start only;
  after that, passwords are changed on the Account page
- Library and speech cache: `/var/lib/book-watcher`
