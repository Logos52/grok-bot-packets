# Mandarin Cards · HSK 1

Static web app for studying the classic HSK 1 set of 150 words.

## Current version · Cards + Thematic Practice + Situations

The app now separates **seeing/understanding a word** from **actively retrieving it**.

### Cards

Each learning card prioritizes:

- Hanzi
- pinyin
- Mandarin pronunciation
- English meaning
- a short English explanation
- one example sentence with Hanzi, pinyin and English

Extra information stays optional behind **Break down**, **Characters**, **Memory tip**, and **Practice this word**.

Cards now include a dedicated **Card Explorer** with:

- global search by Hanzi, pinyin (tone marks optional), or English
- **All words** browsing
- the same **10 thematic blocks** used in Practice
- persistent **focused browsing**
- compact mini-cards for quickly scanning the vocabulary
- context-aware Previous / Next / Shuffle navigation: when a card is opened from a block or search results, navigation stays inside that group

### Practice

The 150 words are reorganized for practice into **10 thematic blocks of 15 related words**. The original vocabulary data is not removed or replaced; the grouping is only a study layer.

Each block can be trained independently with:

- **Meaning** — Hanzi → English and English → Hanzi
- **Hanzi & Pinyin** — written form ↔ pronunciation
- **Listening** — audio → Hanzi, meaning, or pinyin when needed to avoid ambiguous homophones
- **Association** — complete the word inside an example sentence
- **Type Hanzi** — use the device’s Chinese Pinyin keyboard/IME to produce the target Hanzi
- **Mixed practice** — interleaves all five exercise types
- **Review mistakes** — revisits words/skills previously answered incorrectly

Feedback never advances automatically. After every answer the learner can inspect the correct Hanzi, pinyin, English meaning, explanation, example sentence, and replay the audio, then press **Next** manually.

Practice accuracy is stored locally in the browser and tracked separately by word and skill.

### Write Hanzi

The existing Hanzi Writer trainer remains available with stroke-order validation, immediate feedback, hints, and local writing progress.

## Language

All learner-facing explanations and interface text are in **English**. Mandarin content is shown in simplified Hanzi with pinyin.

## Files

- `index.html` — app structure
- `css/foundation.css` — tokens, shared controls and base layouts
- `css/learning.css` — learning and Practice foundations
- `css/cards.css` — flashcard presentation and interactions
- `css/situations.css` — real-life scenario layouts
- `css/duolingo.css` — guided Mandarin Path
- `css/dashboard.css` and `css/practice-studio.css` — dashboard and Practice studio
- `css/write-hanzi.css` and `css/exercises.css` — writing and lesson interfaces
- `css/navigation.css` — sidebar and navigation icon system
- `css/mobile.css` — final phone and compact-screen adaptation layer
- `js/data.js` — original 150-word HSK 1 vocabulary source data
- `js/learning-data.js` — English meanings, explanations, examples and character glosses
- `js/practice-data.js` — 10 thematic practice blocks
- `js/core.js` — shared state, persistence, audio and helpers
- `js/cards.js` — Cards, search and Character Explorer
- `js/write-hanzi.js` — stroke-writing trainer
- `js/practice.js` — exercise engine and feedback
- `js/bootstrap.js` — final event wiring and initial render
- `js/situations.js` — branching real-life scenario engine for the Situations tab
- `assets/favicon.svg` — favicon

The feature scripts are loaded as ordered classic modules so the existing static-hosting setup remains dependency-free. Shared state lives in `core.js`; feature files should contain only behavior for their corresponding section. Phone-specific layout changes belong in `mobile.css` instead of being mixed into component files.

## Run locally

From the project folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If port 8000 is busy, use another port such as `8080`.

## GitHub Pages

This project is fully static and can be published directly from the repository root with GitHub Pages.

## Hanzi writing

Stroke validation uses Hanzi Writer from a CDN. The Cards and Practice areas work locally as normal static interfaces, while stroke-practice loading requires Internet access for that library.

## Vocabulary source

The 150-word vocabulary base follows the MandarinBean HSK 1 list used in the original project. The English teaching notes, example sentences, thematic practice blocks, and exercise logic are learning layers built on top of that vocabulary list.


## v5 — Type Hanzi with your Chinese Pinyin keyboard

Practice blocks now include **Type Hanzi**. The exercise uses a normal web text field so iOS, iPadOS, Android, macOS, and Windows can use their own Chinese Simplified Pinyin IME. The learner types pinyin on the system keyboard, selects the Hanzi candidate, and the app checks the committed Chinese characters.

The mode rotates three cues: visible Hanzi (guided input), English meaning → Hanzi, and listening → Hanzi. It is IME-safe (composition events are respected), never auto-advances, allows retries until the target is produced, and offers optional pinyin/audio hints. First-try unaided performance is what counts toward accuracy.


## v6 — Card Explorer

The Cards section now separates **browsing** from **studying a single word**. Tap **Explore cards** to search the complete HSK 1 set, browse by thematic block, or open focused browsing. Opening a word from any of those views creates a browsing scope, so Previous, Next, and Shuffle remain inside the same set instead of unexpectedly jumping through all 150 words. focused browsing and the active card scope are stored locally in the browser.


### v6.1 navigation cleanup
Card navigation now lives at the top of each learning card with previous/next arrows. The duplicate bottom navigation and Favorites/heart controls were removed to keep the card focused.


## v7 — Situations · At a Restaurant

A new **Situations** section turns vocabulary into a branching 2D-style restaurant interaction. The first scenario is **At a Restaurant** and keeps all learner-facing support in **Hanzi + pinyin + English**.

The restaurant story includes:

- arrival and party-size interaction
- a real choice of seating
- water or tea branches
- a three-item menu with different meal paths
- ordering language that depends on the learner’s own food choice
- table conversation with multiple valid reactions
- a repeatable table hub, so the story does not force an immediate ending
- optional extra water or tea
- optional takeout
- Chinese Pinyin-keyboard input for asking for the bill
- multiple payment routes
- a farewell interaction and a route summary
- a phrase book that unlocks useful language during the scenario

Wrong answers do not kill the story or auto-advance. They give feedback and allow another attempt. Valid choices are remembered and reused later in the scenario. The official 150-word HSK 1 dataset remains unchanged; restaurant-specific language is treated as situation vocabulary rather than added to the HSK count.


## v8.1 — Game-style Situations

The Restaurant situation has been redesigned to feel much closer to a lightweight 2D story game while remaining a static web app:

- a game-style Situation catalog with a featured restaurant scenario
- an illustrated top-down restaurant world built with responsive inline SVG/CSS
- visible player, host/waiter, friend, tables, counter, menu and food scenes
- floating **Talk** interaction in the world
- dialogue overlays inside the scene, using Hanzi + pinyin + English
- richer response cards with icons, feedback and manual continuation
- food-selection cards that resemble an in-world restaurant menu
- a free-choice table hub with tappable world hotspots and repeatable interactions
- compact game controls for Listen, Hint, Phrase Book and Your Route
- Phrase Book and route history moved into optional drawers instead of a permanent sidebar
- the existing branching restaurant logic, Chinese keyboard task, and non-dead-ending story are preserved

This version intentionally does not add a full movement/physics engine yet. It tests the RPG/point-and-click presentation first while keeping the code lightweight and GitHub Pages compatible.

- Multi-character words such as 衣服 display every character side-by-side and centered.
- The active character remains stroke-validated while the other characters stay visible as guides.
- Completed characters remain visible while the next character becomes active.
- The writing stage automatically scales for 1, 2, 3, or more characters without overlapping.

## v13.5 true single-Hanzi centering
- Fixed the actual cause of off-center single-character writing stages.

- Suppresses the click event that browsers can fire immediately after a drag, which previously could move the next block too.

## v13.17 — Sentence Builder feedback + guaranteed four-way rotation
- Wrong answers now open the same feedback panel as correct answers.
- Wrong feedback says “Not quite.” and shows the correct block order below.
- Sentence Builder explicitly cycles through all four forms:
  1. English → Hanzi
  2. Hanzi + pinyin → English
  3. Pinyin → Hanzi
  4. Hanzi → pinyin
- The cycle repeats across the 15-question session so no variant is accidentally skipped.
