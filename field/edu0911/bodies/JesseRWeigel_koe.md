# Koe (声) — AI-Powered Language Learning

An open-source, AI-powered language learning app that takes you from beginner to fluency. Built for serious learners who are tired of juggling 5 different apps.

**Currently supports**: Japanese, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese

## Why Koe?

Most language apps are great at getting you started (A1-A2) but abandon you at the intermediate plateau. Koe is designed to carry you from zero through to real fluency by combining the best evidence-based methods:

- **FSRS Spaced Repetition** — State-of-the-art algorithm that adapts to your memory patterns, reducing reviews by 20-30% vs traditional SRS
- **AI Conversation Partner** — Practice speaking with an AI that adapts to your level, corrects mistakes inline, and never judges you
- **Graded Reader** — AI-generated reading content at exactly your comprehension level with inline word lookup and audio
- **Grammar on Demand** — Grammar explanations when you need them, not front-loaded textbook style
- **Honest Progress Tracking** — Know what you can actually do, not just how many days you've logged in

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **UI**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Database**: [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/) (serverless)
- **AI**: [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) with dual provider support:
  - **Cloud**: Vercel AI Gateway (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
  - **Local**: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (run models on your own GPU — no API costs)
- **SRS**: [ts-fsrs](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/ts-fsrs) (FSRS algorithm)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended) or npm
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) account (free tier works) or local Postgres

### AI Provider Setup (choose one or both)

**Option A: Local models with Ollama (free, private, requires GPU)**

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull qwen3.5:9b` (fits in 16GB+ VRAM, fast responses)
3. Ollama runs on `http://localhost:11434` by default
4. For higher quality with 32GB+ VRAM: `ollama pull qwen3.5:27b` and set `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL=qwen3.5:27b` in `.env.local`

**Option B: Cloud models via Vercel AI Gateway**

1. Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project
2. Enable AI Gateway in the Vercel dashboard
3. Set `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` for local development, or run `vercel link && vercel env pull` to get `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`
4. Set `DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER=gateway`; requests then use the Vercel AI Gateway endpoint and the `GATEWAY_*_MODEL` for their purpose

Without an API key, the Gateway SDK resolves OIDC from Vercel request context
or the environment and can refresh linked development tokens. Missing
authentication fails before the gateway request is sent. Provider diagnostics
report this mode as `sdk-managed` without exposing or claiming a credential.

`AI_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` defaults to `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v3/ai`.
An override must be the final HTTPS gateway endpoint and cannot contain URL
credentials, a query string, or a fragment. Redirects are rejected so gateway
credentials are sent only to that configured endpoint.

AI endpoints default to loopback-only local mode in development and require explicit hosted authentication plus shared Postgres budgets when deployed. See [AI route deployment modes](docs/ai-route-security.md) before exposing Koe.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/JesseRWeigel/koe.git
cd koe

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your database URL and AI provider settings

# Set up the database
pnpm db:push

# Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start learning.

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database (required)
