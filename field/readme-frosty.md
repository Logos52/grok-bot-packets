# anki-card-forge

[![CI](https://github.com/FrostySL/anki-card-forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FrostySL/anki-card-forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Turn **lecture scripts, books, slides and notes** into high-quality **Anki
flashcards** — together with an AI assistant of your choice.
The workflow is **AI-provider independent**, works for **any subject**, and
produces cards in **any language you ask for**.

Your assistant reads your source and writes the cards. The local tools prepare
the source, check the cards, and create an `.apkg` file — an Anki deck package
you can import and study.

**The repository makes no model API calls and needs no provider API key.**
You choose and set up the AI assistant separately; its subscription, model
access, and handling of your source data depend on that service.

[Windows setup](#windows-11-x64) · [Linux / WSL2 setup](#linux--wsl2) ·
[Your first deck](#create-your-first-deck) · [AnkiConnect](#optional-drive-anki-directly-ankiconnect) ·
[Updating learned decks](#updating-an-already-learned-deck-without-losing-progress)

## Requirements

- **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** to import and study the finished deck.
- **An AI assistant with project access.** Open this project folder in an
  assistant that can read and write its files and run terminal commands.
  It also needs image viewing for diagrams and card preview checks; if that
  is unavailable, you need to inspect those images yourself.
- **Internet for the first setup.** The tools download their dependencies.
  Your chosen AI assistant has its own internet requirements.

Choose the setup for your computer:

| Platform | What you need before setup |
|---|---|
| **Windows 11 x64** | A writable project folder. Setup installs the tools locally; no preinstalled Python, Git, Docker, WSL, or administrator rights are required. |
| **Linux / WSL2** | Git, Bash, Python 3.10+, and Docker with a running daemon. Building, extraction, and rendering use Docker. |

macOS, Windows ARM64, and a Docker-free Linux setup are not supported.

**Optional:** [AnkiConnect](ANKICONNECT.md) imports directly into the running
desktop Anki app. You can also import the finished file manually.

Using a chat assistant without project access is a manual alternative: provide
the instructions and source material yourself, save the returned card JSON,
and run the [tools](#tools) on your computer.

## Quick start

Run setup once for your platform, then continue with
[Create your first deck](#create-your-first-deck).

### Windows 11 x64

On this repository's GitHub page, choose **Code → Download ZIP** and extract
it, or clone the repository if you use Git. Open the extracted project folder
that contains `forge.cmd` in your AI assistant.

Ask the assistant to run the following commands, or open PowerShell in that
folder and run them yourself:

```powershell
.\forge.cmd setup
.\forge.cmd doctor
```

Setup downloads and checks the required tools. `doctor` checks whether the
environment is ready without downloading or installing anything. English and
German OCR are included. If setup fails, read the reported error and see
[Windows setup details](docs/cross-platform-setup.md).

Once setup succeeds, continue with [your first deck](#create-your-first-deck).

### Linux / WSL2

Run these commands in your Linux terminal. `docker info` must succeed as your
normal user; if it does not, follow [the Docker setup notes](#docker-on-linux-and-wsl2)
first.

```bash
docker info
git clone https://github.com/FrostySL/anki-card-forge
cd anki-card-forge
./tools/setup.sh
```

Setup checks Docker and Python, enables the commit guard for personal files,
and builds the bundled example deck to check the tools. Open this project
folder in your AI assistant, then continue below.

## Create your first deck

These steps are the same on Windows and Linux/WSL2.

### 1. Add your source

Create a folder for your topic inside `sources/`, then place a PDF, text file,
or Markdown file in it. For example:

```text
sources/Biology/respiration.pdf
```

This is an example path: use your own document and create its topic folder.

### 2. Ask your assistant to make the cards

In the assistant where you opened the project, paste this prompt. Replace
the source path with your own:

```text
Read AGENTS.md, skills/card-authoring/SKILL.md, and workflows/forge.md first.
Follow those instructions to create Anki cards from
sources/Biology/respiration.pdf, run the quality checks, and produce the
finished .apkg.
```

You can add wishes such as "make 10 cards" or "write the cards in German".
The assistant handles source preparation, card writing, previews, and checks.
Expect several minutes even for a small deck, especially on the first run.
Review any issues it reports before studying the cards.

For the example path, the results are:

- `decks/Biology/respiration.cards.json` — the editable card content.
- `decks/Biology/respiration.apkg` — the finished package to import into Anki.

### 3. Import and study

Double-click the `.apkg`, or open **File → Import** in desktop Anki and select
it. The deck appears under its topic, such as **Biology**.

To study on your phone, sync the imported desktop collection to AnkiWeb and
then sync AnkiMobile or AnkiDroid.

With the optional [AnkiConnect add-on](#optional-drive-anki-directly-ankiconnect),
you can ask the assistant to import the finished deck directly. Sync is a
separate action and only runs when you ask for it.

Already studied a deck and want to change it? Use
[the update workflow](#updating-an-already-learned-deck-without-losing-progress)
to preserve its learning progress.

## Example: one prompt, start to finish

The deck in the GIF above was made like this — a real, unedited session
recorded with Claude Code. The screenshots document that example; the shared
workflow above can be used with other assistants.

**1. Get a source.** Anything that fits in a PDF or text file. Here: the
Wikipedia article [Electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)
as PDF, plus the article's circuit diagram in high resolution (a CC0 file from
Wikimedia Commons) for the image-occlusion cards.

![The Electric current Wikipedia article, opened as PDF](docs/img/example-1-source-pdf.png)

**2. Drop it into `sources/<topic>/`:**

![The PDF placed at sources/Physics/electric_current.pdf](docs/img/example-2-sources-folder.png)

**3. Ask.** In this recording, one sentence in the Claude Code chat:

![Prompt: Make 10 English Anki cards from sources/Physics/electric_current.pdf with image occlusion. Import the deck into Anki via AnkiConnect.](docs/img/example-3-prompt.png)

**4. Claude does the rest** — extracts the PDF, authors the cards following the
methodology, places the occlusion masks on the circuit diagram, runs the whole
quality pipeline on its own work, and (since AnkiConnect was installed) imports
the finished deck straight into Anki. Expect this to take a while — several
minutes even for a small deck; the time goes into the self-checks, not just
the writing:

![Claude's final report: 10 cards built, checked and imported into Anki](docs/img/example-4-result.png)

**5. Study.** That is the GIF at the top: 7 basic cards plus 3 image-occlusion
cards masking *v*, *i* and *R* on the circuit — fresh out of the forge.

## Any topic, any language

The project is deliberately generic — biology, law, math, software engineering,
history: if it fits in a PDF or text file, it can become cards. Cards default to
the language of your source material. Want something else? Just tell your assistant:

> "Make the cards from sources/Histoire/revolution.pdf — cards in French, please."

For scanned PDFs, also select the matching OCR language (OCR reads text from
scanned images). On Windows, install it with `.\forge.cmd setup --lang fra`
and prepare the source with `.\forge.cmd prep sources/Histoire --lang fra`.
On Linux/WSL2, add the language pack to `Dockerfile.extract` and pass `--lang`
(e.g. `./tools/extract.sh … --lang eng+fra`).

Optionally place a `context.md` next to your sources (what the material is for,
where the focus lies, what the exam covers) — the assistant reads it first and weights
the cards accordingly.

## Commands on Windows and Linux

The reference examples below use Linux commands. On Windows, use `forge.cmd`
with the same arguments. Run commands from the project folder and quote paths
that contain spaces.

| Linux command | Windows equivalent |
|---|---|
| `./tools/prep.sh` | `.\forge.cmd prep` |
| `./tools/finish.sh` | `.\forge.cmd finish` |
| `./tools/build.sh` | `.\forge.cmd build` |
| `./tools/preview.sh` | `.\forge.cmd preview` |
| `python3 tools/apkg_to_cards.py` | `.\forge.cmd decode` |
| `python3 tools/deck_diff.py` | `.\forge.cmd diff` |
| `python3 tools/anki_connect.py` | `.\forge.cmd anki` |

Other Windows subcommands are `extract`, `figextract`, `figindex`, `detect`,
`lint`, `grounding`, `coverage`, `validate`, and `test`.

Wildcards such as `decks/Biology/*.cards.json` are expanded by the Windows
launcher. Media paths inside card JSON stay relative to the project and use
`/` on both platforms.

For HTML field arguments with embedded quotes or `&`, invoke `& .\forge.ps1`
directly in PowerShell. See the
[PowerShell example and execution-policy notes](docs/cross-platform-setup.md).

## Optional: drive Anki directly (AnkiConnect)

**Entirely optional** — without it you import the `.apkg` by double-click /
*File → Import*, and nothing else in this repo changes. With the
[AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on installed
(code `2055492159`, then restart Anki), finished decks go straight into your
collection over **local HTTP** by default, without passing AnkiWeb
credentials to the tool. Explicit AnkiWeb sync sends collection data to
AnkiWeb:

```bash
python3 tools/anki_connect.py ping                    # is Anki + add-on reachable?
python3 tools/anki_connect.py decks                   # list all deck names
python3 tools/anki_connect.py push decks/<topic>/<name>.apkg   # import a built deck
python3 tools/anki_connect.py push <name>.apkg --dry-run       # what WOULD change?
python3 tools/anki_connect.py export "<Deck>" out.apkg # export WITH scheduling
python3 tools/anki_connect.py sync                    # trigger AnkiWeb sync
python3 tools/anki_connect.py mirror                  # local backup of all decks
python3 tools/anki_connect.py update-note <nid> --field "Back=..."   # edit one note in place
python3 tools/anki_connect.py restore --list         # list backup snapshots
python3 tools/anki_connect.py restore                # restore and verify the newest snapshot
```

`./tools/finish.sh … --push [--prune] [--sync]` chains it into the build:
validate, import, optionally remove cards you cut from the deck, optionally
sync to AnkiWeb/phone.

By default, each push backs up the affected decks in `decks/_anki-backups/`.
Use `restore` to recover backed-up content: it makes a fresh backup, restores
the selected content, and verifies that existing cards keep their current
learning progress. An ordinary import of an older package may leave newer
content unchanged. Restore leaves later-added notes in place and does not
roll back deck placement or note-type styling; see the
[restore details](ANKICONNECT.md#backups--restore).

The API allowlist restricts available actions. Removing cards requires the
explicit `--prune` option and its additional checks; sync never runs implicitly.

**Full documentation — setup, all commands, backups & restore, safeguards,
workflows, troubleshooting: [ANKICONNECT.md](ANKICONNECT.md).**

## Updating an already-learned deck (without losing progress)

Start from a fresh Anki export when changing cards you have already studied.
Preserve note identifiers (GUIDs), note types, and card numbering so updates
keep the existing learning progress. Rebuilding edited cards without their
original GUIDs can create duplicates. Give your assistant
[the rework workflow](workflows/rework.md), or follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. In Anki: File → Export → .apkg (with scheduling) — or, with AnkiConnect:
python3 tools/anki_connect.py export "<Deck>" export.apkg
# 2. Back to editable JSON, GUIDs preserved (modern exports need zstd):
python3 tools/apkg_to_cards.py export.apkg -o decks/<topic>/<name>_rebuild
# 3. Edit the cards.json, then rebuild — re-import UPDATES instead of duplicating:
./tools/build.sh decks/<topic>/<name>_rebuild/*.cards.json "restructured.apkg"
# 4. Verify before importing: exactly the intended changes, no cloze breakage?
python3 tools/deck_diff.py export.apkg restructured.apkg --strict
```

The decoder keeps the third `More` field of type-in and reversed basic notes
in `more`, including existing details/source HTML. Keep it separate from `back`.
It refuses to write incomplete JSON when occlusion notes or unsupported field/
deck layouts would be lost. Edit those notes, and foreign note types, in Anki or
with `anki update-note`; rebuilding them as another type cannot update them safely.

The package diff checks every raw note and field, including occlusion and
foreign types. Strict mode rejects cloze/card-ordinal or note-type/field-layout
changes and ambiguous comparisons. Review reported additions and removals too;
they do not by themselves fail strict mode.

Details (cloze pitfalls, CSS updates): [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Card types

- **basic** — question/answer (with `reverse: true` also both directions).
- **cloze** — fill-in-the-blank `{{c1::…}}`.
- **typein** — type the answer, Anki compares (for exact spellings).
- **occlusion** — image with hidden regions (anatomy, diagrams …), self-rendered
  HTML/CSS overlay that works in every Anki version.

On **every** card, optionally a collapsed "Details & source" box
(`explanation` + `source`) — elaborative feedback after the retrieval, without
making the question easier. Full card JSON format: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

```json
{
  "deck": "Biology::Cellular respiration",
  "cards": [
    { "type": "basic",
      "front": "Where in the cell does cellular respiration take place?",
      "back": "In the mitochondria.",
      "source": "script p. 12", "tags": ["bio"] }
  ]
}
```

## The quality pipeline

The assistant follows [evidence-based card rules](skills/card-authoring/SKILL.md):
one retrievable fact per card, clear questions, and no hints that give away the
answer. The tools package its card JSON with
[`genanki`](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) and support these checks:

| Step | Tool | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `tools/lint_cards.py` | empty fields, missing deletions, bad occlusion coordinates, duplicate questions, typo'd field names |
| Grounding | `tools/grounding_check.py` | flags possible unsupported answers and wrong page citations for review |
| Coverage | `tools/coverage.py` | near-duplicate cards across files, source pages without any card |
| Preview | `tools/preview.sh` | renders light/dark images for visual inspection of layout and occlusion masks |
| Validate | `tools/validate.sh` | import errors, render errors, empty cards — in the real Anki engine |

Shortcut: `./tools/finish.sh decks/<topic>/<name>.cards.json` runs
lint + grounding + build + validate in one go; give it several `cards.json`
plus a target `.apkg` and it bundles a whole topic (and adds the coverage check).

Grounding is a heuristic, not a guarantee of factual accuracy. The assistant
reviews its warnings against the source. Preview images need to be inspected
by the assistant or by you; `finish` does not run that visual review. The
validator checks import and rendering in Anki's actual backend.

## Saving tokens: run the extraction toolchain yourself

Your assistant normally runs the whole pipeline for you. The **source
preparation** step (PDF → Markdown + figure crops) is pure tooling — no AI
involved — and you can run it yourself before starting the chat to avoid
spending tokens on tool orchestration:

```bash
./tools/prep.sh sources/<topic>/            # whole folder, or a single PDF
```

This produces, per source file:

- `extracted/<topic>/<name>.md` — machine-readable Markdown with page markers
  (`<!-- p. 12 -->`), scanned pages OCR'd and marked `(OCR)`,
- `extracted/<topic>/<name>.figures.md` — an index of the figures per page,
- `extracted/<topic>/figures/<name>_p<page>_<i>.png` — cropped figures (for
  image-occlusion cards and cheap visual checks).

Then tell your assistant *"the sources are already prepared — make cards from
extracted/<topic>/…"* and it skips straight to reading and authoring. Everything
else (lint, grounding, preview, build, validate) is also runnable by hand — see
the tools table below.

## Shared guide, skill, and workflows

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the provider-neutral project guide and card JSON
reference. [skills/card-authoring/SKILL.md](skills/card-authoring/SKILL.md)
contains the authoring rules, with their evidence in
[research.md](skills/card-authoring/research.md). These are ordinary Markdown
files: an assistant can read and follow them without a skill registry or
provider-specific installation.

Use [workflows/forge.md](workflows/forge.md) for new cards and
[workflows/rework.md](workflows/rework.md) for existing decks. For example:

> Read `AGENTS.md`, `skills/card-authoring/SKILL.md`, and
> `workflows/rework.md`. Rework my exported deck `sources/Biology/export.apkg`
> while preserving its note GUIDs and learning progress.

**Optional Claude Code integration:** The adapters in `.claude/` point to
the shared instructions. Claude Code users can keep using
`/forge sources/<topic>/<file>` and `/rework`; the optional
`.claude/settings.json` hook adds automatic lint feedback after card edits.
Other assistants run the same checks through the documented shell commands.

## Setup details

### Windows maintenance and offline use

Dependencies and caches live in `.forge/` and `.venv/`; keep both local.
Repeating `.\forge.cmd setup` reuses installed components and repairs missing
or damaged ones. `setup --offline` uses only local components and caches.
After setup, processing local sources and rendering formulas work offline;
the AI assistant has its own requirements.

Keep the project in a reasonably short writable path, and run setup again
after moving it to another machine. See
[Windows setup details](docs/cross-platform-setup.md) and
[platform acceptance tests](tests/integration/README.md).

### Docker on Linux and WSL2

You can install **Docker Engine directly in Linux**, including Ubuntu inside
WSL2; Docker Desktop is optional. Follow the official
[Docker Engine installation for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
and [Linux post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
so your normal user can run Docker. Run this project's Bash, Python, and Docker
build commands inside that Linux environment, from the project directory.
Before running `setup.sh`, this must succeed without `sudo`:

```bash
docker info
```

With [systemd enabled in WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/systemd)
and the Docker service enabled, Docker starts when the Ubuntu distribution
starts. This does not launch Ubuntu at Windows startup or keep WSL running
indefinitely. If Anki runs on Windows while the project runs in WSL, use the
[Windows Anki connection instructions](ANKICONNECT.md#wsl2-project-with-anki-on-windows).

The extraction and preview Docker images are built automatically on first use.
Host-side lint, grounding, and coverage checks use Python's standard library.
Reading modern Anki exports/backups additionally needs Python `zstandard` or
the `zstd` CLI; see [AnkiConnect setup](ANKICONNECT.md#setup-once).

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools/prep.sh` | prepare a source in one step: `extract` + figure index + `figextract` |
| `tools/extract.sh` | PDF → Markdown (parallel OCR for scans; incl. figure index via `figindex.py`) |
| `tools/figextract.sh` | crop figures out of the PDF → PNG crops + manifest |
| `tools/detect.sh` | OCR (Tesseract): detect label boxes for image occlusion |
| `tools/lint_cards.py` | fast content/structure check (pure Python, no Docker) |
| `tools/grounding_check.py` | anti-hallucination: are the answers really in the source text? |
| `tools/coverage.py` | near-duplicates + source-page coverage across a whole topic |
| `tools/build.sh` | card JSON → `.apkg` (genanki); also bundles several JSONs into one file |
| `tools/preview.sh` | cards → PNG previews, light + night mode (headless Chromium) |
| `tools/validate.sh` | check the `.apkg` in the real Anki engine (import + render) |
| `tools/finish.sh` | shortcut: lint + grounding (+ coverage) + build + validate in one; `--push [--sync]` sends the result into Anki |
| `tools/apkg_to_cards.py` | `.apkg` → `cards.json` back, GUIDs **and media** preserved (edit learned decks without losing progress) |
| `tools/deck_diff.py` | diff two deck versions by note GUID: added/removed/changed notes, cloze-safety warnings — verify a rework **before** pushing it |
| `tools/anki_connect.py` | optional: drive a running Anki via the AnkiConnect add-on — `push` (`--dry-run`)/`export`/`sync`/`mirror`/`decks`/`restore`, local HTTP, no credentials ([docs](ANKICONNECT.md)) |
| `tools/setup.sh` | one-command setup + health check for a fresh clone (Docker/Python, commit guard, builder image, example-deck smoke test) |
| `tools/test.sh` | test suite of the logic tools (stdlib `unittest`, no Docker/pip) |

## Privacy: local files and your AI service

Sources, extracts, and generated decks are stored locally and excluded from
Git via `.gitignore`. The **commit guard** (`.githooks/pre-commit`, enabled
with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) additionally blocks commits that
would add personal material (PDFs, `.apkg`, files under `sources/`,
`extracted/`, `decks/`) — even with `git add -f`. Its shared path allowlist lives
in `tools/check_repo_files.py`; CI checks the same policy against all tracked
files. The repository contains the tools, methodology, and one example deck.

These Git protections prevent accidental commits; they do not control what
your AI assistant sends to its model provider. Source text, images, and cards
that a cloud assistant reads may be sent to that service, depending on its
settings and data policy. Choose an appropriate service for your material.
A local model is also an option when your agent tooling supports it and the
required file, shell, and image capabilities.

AnkiConnect talks to the local Anki app by default. An explicitly requested
AnkiWeb sync transfers collection data to AnkiWeb.
