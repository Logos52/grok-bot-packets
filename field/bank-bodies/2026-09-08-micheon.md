## What it is

Micheon teaches German the way you'll actually use it: whole sentences and real conversations, not flashcard word-lists. It bundles a hand-built, natively-verified curriculum and pairs it with a smart answer-checker that accepts the *many* ways a person really phrases something — so you're graded on whether you understood the German, not on hitting one exact string.

It ships as a Windows installer with automatic updates. Under the hood it's a React front-end wrapped in Electron, with a tiny local Express server that generates Microsoft neural TTS audio on demand.

## Who it's for

- **Self-learners** who want to reach confident, conversational — up to roughly university-level — German without paying a monthly fee or handing their data to a cloud service.
- **Offline learners** — commuters, travellers, anyone with unreliable internet. The whole app works with no connection.
- **German speakers learning English.** Set your interface language to Deutsch and the direction flips: the app speaks German to you and teaches the same expressions in English.
- **Privacy-minded people.** Your progress lives in a local store on your machine, not on someone's server.

## What you can do

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Guided lessons** | Learn a batch of new material, then identify, type, translate, fill gaps, and rebuild it from memory. Correct typed answers auto-advance — no clicking "Check". Each lesson mixes new items with review so nothing fades. |
| **Premium voice** | Every sentence can be read aloud in a natural Microsoft neural voice (via `edge-tts`), generated locally. A waveform reacts while it speaks. |
| **Smart answer matching** | Write it your way. The checker forgives typos, contractions, British/American spelling, articles, word-order-preserving paraphrases, and a large library of synonyms — while still rejecting genuinely wrong answers, wrong tense, and reversed meaning. |
| **Spaced review** | Items you've seen come back on a memory-strength schedule so they stick for the long term. |
| **Desktop learning pets** | Animated companions live on your desktop and actively help you remember. They ask whether you still recall learned words and phrases, bring struggling material back sooner, give useful language-specific grammar tips, and run a recall checkpoint after each lesson before new material is introduced. Pets can be moved, resized, muted, or hidden whenever you want. |
| **Micheon Immersion for Chromium** | An optional companion extension for Chrome, Edge, and Brave. It adds bilingual hover definitions to Micheon vocabulary while you browse, collects unfamiliar German words for review, and selects an official German YouTube audio track with English captions when one is available. |
| **Vocabulary games** | Eight arcade-style games (Snake, Whack-a-Mole, Falling Letters, Verb Shooter, Minesweeper, and more) that drill vocab without feeling like study. |
| **Grammar drills** | Cloze (fill-in-the-blank) exercises and grammar notes for the patterns behind the sentences. |
| **Fluency meter & gamification** | Track known-word count toward a fluency estimate, earn XP, keep a daily streak, level up, and unlock milestones. |
| **Micheon appearance** | Choose light, dark, or system mode, then use a curated accent preset or any custom colour. Micheon derives readable text, hover, pressed, and soft-selection shades from your choice and saves it on your device. |
| **Learning direction** | Switch between *learn German*, *learn English*, *learn French* and *learn Polish*; the interface, prompts, and lesson make-up follow the language you pick. |
| **Multiple courses** | German is the flagship; English, French and Polish are taught from the same catalogue, narrowed to what each language covers, and the course registry also carries a Spanish track and a bonus C# course, selectable from the course switcher. |
| **Local accounts** | Per-machine profiles keep each person's progress separate and sync across browser/app restarts — no account server involved. |

## Getting started

### Option A — Install the app (recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Leon2k909/Micheon/releases) page.
2. Download the build for your system:
   - **Windows** — `Micheon-Setup-x.y.z.exe`
   - **Linux** — the `.AppImage` (make it executable and run it) or the `.deb`
3. Run it. Micheon installs, creates a menu entry, and launches.
4. Create a local profile, pick your course, and start your first daily lesson.

The app checks for updates on its own and installs them the next time you close it.

### Option B — Run from source

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leon2k909/Micheon.git
cd Micheon        # (the working folder is named "germ")
npm install

# Web dev server + local TTS server together, with hot reload:
npm run dev

# Or run it as the actual desktop app:
npm run electron
```

`npm run dev` starts Vite (the UI) and the Express TTS server side by side. Open the printed local URL in your browser, or use `npm run electron` for the full desktop experience with the title bar and auto-update wiring.

## Micheon Immersion browser extension

Micheon includes an optional Manifest V3 extension for **Chrome, Edge, and Brave**. It is a browsing companion rather than a full-page translator: it reinforces vocabulary from Micheon's bundled word bank while leaving the page itself intact.

- **Learn from normal browsing.** Known Micheon vocabulary receives a dotted underline and a translation tooltip on hover or keyboard focus. German pages show the English meaning; on other pages, recognised English words can show the German you are learning. Hovering can also pronounce the German; a brief settling delay and latest-word-wins playback prevent repeated or overlapping speech as the pointer moves.
- **Find useful gaps in the curriculum.** On pages detected as German, the extension keeps a local candidate list of plausible words it does not recognise, including one real sentence where each word appeared. You can review, reset, or export that list as JSON. Candidates are never added to lessons automatically.
- **Use German audio on YouTube.** When a video provides an official German audio track, the extension selects it and enables English captions. Videos without a German track are left unchanged.

### Install it from the desktop app

1. Open **More → Profile and settings → Browser extension** in Micheon.
2. Select **Set up the extension folder**. Micheon copies the unpacked extension to a stable folder in Documents and opens it in Explorer.
3. Open `chrome://extensions`, `edge://extensions`, or `brave://extensions` in the matching browser.
4. Enable **Developer mode**, select **Load unpacked**, and choose the folder Micheon opened.
5. Pin **Micheon Immersion** if you want its status and candidate-word controls within easy reach.

Chromium deliberately prevents apps from silently installing unpacked extensions, so the **Load unpacked** step must be confirmed in the browser. When Micheon is running outside the desktop shell, the same settings card offers a ZIP download that can be extracted and loaded instead.

The version shown in Brave comes from the Micheon release that supplied the files. After a Micheon update, select **Set up for Brave** again, then press **Reload** on the existing Micheon Immersion card at `brave://extensions` and refresh pages that were already open. Brave does not automatically activate changed files for an unpacked extension.

### How words and data reach the extension

- Micheon's hardcoded lesson packs and bundled word bank are the source of truth. Every app build runs `npm run sync:immersion-extension`, which exports the deduplicated catalogue to `data/words.json` and rebuilds the downloadable extension archive before packaging Micheon.
- The release build refuses to ship changed extension files unless both the extension version and Micheon app version advance, ensuring every extension update reaches Git and the desktop autoupdater together.
- Installing or updating Micheon therefore supplies a new offline word snapshot. **Set up for Brave** copies that exact snapshot to the stable `Documents/Micheon Immersion Extension` folder; it does not download a separate or newer extension from the internet.
- There is no hidden account or progress sync between Micheon and Chromium at present. Extension settings and discovered-word candidates live in `chrome.storage.local`; app profiles and mastery records stay in Micheon's local profile store. The extension can use Micheon's `127.0.0.1` TTS service while the desktop app is running, but that is audio playback rather than data sync.
- New words found while browsing can be exported from the extension as JSON for review. They are deliberately not injected into lessons automatically: they only reach both products after being checked, authored, and added to Micheon's hardcoded catalogue.

All vocabulary matching and language detection run on the device against the word list bundled with the extension. It does not call a translation API, require a Micheon account, or upload its candidate-word list; extension preferences and candidates stay in Chromium's local extension storage.

## How to use it, day to day

1. **Pick up where you left off.** The dashboard's *Continue learning* card drops you into the next lesson.
2. **Work through a lesson.** You'll see the German sentence and its meaning. Depending on the step you'll choose what you heard, type the answer, translate it, fill a gap, or rebuild it from memory. Tap **Hear it** any time to hear a native voice. Get a typed answer right and it moves on automatically.
3. **Check what you remember with your pet.** At the end of a lesson, your desktop companion asks you to recall each item before revealing the answer. Anything you mark **Not yet** is reviewed again before Micheon introduces fresh material.
4. **Do your scheduled reviews.** Your pet also checks learned words and phrases between lessons. Confident answers move further along the spaced-repetition schedule; forgotten items return sooner.
5. **Play a game or two.** When you want a break that's still practice, the Games tab drills your current vocabulary.
6. **Make it yours.** Open *More → Profile and settings* to adjust your desktop pet, learning direction, and personal preferences.

## How it works (architecture)

Micheon is deliberately simple and self-contained:

- **UI** — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS and animated with Framer Motion. Components live in `src/`.
- **Content** — bundled as data in `src/lib/` (`data.ts` for authored lessons, plus phrasebank packs). No content is fetched at runtime, and no paid APIs are used. The curriculum is assembled and ordered in `src/lib/curriculum.ts`.
- **Answer matching** — `src/lib/germanTextMatch.ts` runs a tiered comparison: exact → contractions → articles-ignored → synonym/paraphrase canonicalisation → compound-spacing → typo tolerance → meaning-reduced ordered match. It's tuned to accept how real people phrase things while still failing wrong answers.
- **Lesson audio** — `server/index.js` is a small Express server that turns text into Microsoft neural-voice audio with `edge-tts-universal`, served locally (default port `41730`). The Speak lesson stage is temporarily paused, and the desktop build contains no downloadable speech-recognition model.
- **Desktop shell** — `electron/main.js` wraps the UI, hosts the TTS server, provides the custom title bar, and handles automatic updates via `electron-updater`.
- **Desktop pets** — `src/components/codexPets/` renders animated companions, proactive recall questions, lesson memory checks, message history, and language-focused tips. Pet answers update the same spaced-repetition records used by lessons and Continue Learning.
- **Chromium companion** — `dist/micheon-immersion-extension/` contains the bundled Manifest V3 extension, its offline word-list snapshot, webpage glossing and candidate collection, and YouTube audio-track handling.
- **Accounts & sync** — profiles and progress are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, backed by a machine-local shared store so the same profile follows you across app restarts. Preferences sync the same way.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite UI + local TTS server together (hot reload). |
| `npm run dev:web` | UI only. |
| `npm run server` | TTS server only. |
| `npm run build` | Production build of the UI. |
| `npm run electron` | Build, then launch the desktop app. |
| `npm run electron:dist` | Build and package a Windows installer with electron-builder. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint. |

## Building a release

Releases are built by CI. Bump the version, push, and publish a GitHub release for the `vX.Y.Z` tag — [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) then packages Windows and Linux on clean runners and attaches the artifacts (`.exe` + `latest.yml`, `.AppImage` + `.deb` + `latest-linux.yml`). Existing installs pick up the update automatically on next launch.

Locally, `npm run electron:dist` produces a build under `release/` for testing. Note that antivirus real-time scanning can lock the extracted Electron binaries mid-package on Windows (`EPERM ... rename win-unpacked.tmp`) — which is precisely why release packaging lives in CI.

## Third-party data

The spoken word frequencies that order the vocabulary queue come from a
subtitle-derived frequency list. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

## Design principles

- **Offline first, free forever.** Content is bundled; no subscriptions, no per-request AI costs, no telemetry.
- **Sentences, not word-lists.** Coverage grows through verified sentence and dialogue packs so you're rarely surprised in real conversation.
- **Natively verified content.** New material is checked by native-speaker review before it ships.
- **Understanding over exact strings.** If what you typed means the same thing, it counts.
