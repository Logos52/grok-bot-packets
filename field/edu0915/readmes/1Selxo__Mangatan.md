Release IPAs are intentionally unsigned. AltStore, SideStore, Feather, Sideloadly, and similar tools sign the app with your Apple ID during installation.

To build an IPA without publishing a release, open **Actions → Build iOS sideload IPA → Run workflow**. Download the IPA from the completed run's artifacts. Pushing a `v*` tag also attaches the IPA to that GitHub release and refreshes the sideloading source.

### Anki on iOS

The iOS build exports cards through AnkiMobile callbacks instead of
AnkiConnect. In **Settings → Dictionary → Anki**, tap **Refresh** once to open
AnkiMobile and import its current decks, note types, and fields. Mining then
opens AnkiMobile to add the note and returns to Mangatan when the note succeeds;
images and audio are transferred locally during that callback.

Japanese word audio is enabled by default with JapanesePod101, Jisho.org, and
LanguagePod101. Audio sources are ordered fallbacks: add, remove, edit, or move
multiple built-in and custom URL/JSON sources from the same Anki settings page.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

To get started with extension development, see the archived upstream [Dart extension guide](https://github.com/kodjodevf/mangayomi-extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING-DART.md) or [JavaScript extension guide](https://github.com/kodjodevf/mangayomi-extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING-JS.md).

## Using flutter_rust_bridge

To run and build this app, you need to have
[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
and [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed on your system.
You can check that your system is ready with the commands below.
Note that all the Flutter subcomponents should be installed.

```bash
rustc --version
flutter doctor
```

You also need to have the CLI tool for flutter_rust_bridge ready.

```bash
cargo install 'flutter_rust_bridge_codegen'
```

run the following command:

```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

Now you can run and build this app just like any other Flutter projects.

```bash
flutter run
```

### macOS quick build

On macOS, use the helper script to build the desktop app and open it:

```bash
./scripts/build_macos.sh
```

Useful options:

```bash
./scripts/build_macos.sh --release
./scripts/build_macos.sh --clean --no-open
```
